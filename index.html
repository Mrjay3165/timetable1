        <p>nth-child() Selector: This selector is used to match the elements based on their position in a group of siblings. It
        matches every element that is the nth-child, regardless of the type, of its parent.</p>

        <p>nth-of-type() Selector: This Selector is used to style only those elements which are the nth number of children of its
        parent element. Any n may be a number, a keyword, or a formula.children</p>

    <li>   px
        Pixels, or px, are one of the most common length units in CSS.</li>
        
        In CSS, 1 pixel is formally defined as 1/96 of an inch. All other absolute length units are based on this definition of
        a pixel.
        
        But when that standard was originally formulated, most monitors had a resolution of 1024 x 768, and a DPI (dots per
        inch) of 96.
        
        Screens on modern devices have much higher resolutions and DPIs, so a line that's 96 pixels long may not measure exactly
        1 inch, depending on the device.
        
        Even though sizing in pixels can vary across devices, it's generally considered better to use pixels for screens.
        
        If you know that your page will be printed on a high quality printer, then you may consider using another unit like cm</li>
        or mm.
                
    <li>   cm
        Centimeters.
        
        In CSS, 1cm is roughly 37.8 pixels, or about 25.2/64 of an inch.</li>
        
    <li>   mm
        Millimeters.
        
        In CSS, 1mm is roughly 3.78 pixels, or 1/10th of a centimeter.</li>
        
    <li>  in
        Inches.
        
        In CSS, 1in is roughly 96 pixels, or about 2.54cm.</li>
        
    <li>   pt
        Points.
        
        In CSS, 1pt is roughly 1.3333 pixels, or 1/72th of an inch.</li>
        
    <li>  pc
        Picas.
        
        In CSS, 1pc is roughly 16 pixels, or 1/6 of an inch.</li>
